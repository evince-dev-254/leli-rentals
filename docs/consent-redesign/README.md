# Consent Screen Redesign - Leli Rentals

This folder contains the code for a sleek, glassmorphic redesign of the consent modal, now optimized for **CookieYes**.

## 1. CookieYes Application (Recommended)

Since you are using CookieYes, follow these steps:

1.  **Log in** to your [CookieYes Dashboard](https://app.cookieyes.com/).
2.  Go to **Consent Banner** > **Custom CSS**.
3.  Copy the contents of `cookieyes-redesign.css` and paste it there.
4.  **Save & Publish**.

### What this does:
- Transforms the default white CookieYes banner into a **premium glassmorphic modal**.
- Adds a **dark mesh gradient** (purple/pink) backdrop that blurs the site behind it.
- Styles the buttons and switches to match the Leli Rentals emerald/purple aesthetic.
- Includes smooth fade-in animations.
