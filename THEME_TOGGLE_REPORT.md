## 🎨 Feature Implemented
I have added a **Theme Changing Icon** (Sun/Moon toggle) to the main **Home Bar** (Header).

### Details:
- **Location:** It is placed in the top right section of the header, next to the other icons.
- **Functionality:**
  - Clicking the icon toggles between **Light** and **Dark** modes.
  - The icon changes automatically:
    - ☀️ **Sun** shows when in Dark mode (to switch to Light).
    - 🌙 **Moon** shows when in Light mode (to switch to Dark).
- **Mobile Support:** The icon is visible on both Desktop and Mobile views.

### Files Modified:
- `components/layout/header.tsx`
